# emacs

This is my .emacs file with elisp modules uploaded as well - just in case they dissappear from external repos.

In this .emacs emphasis is put on :

- org-mode integration - full support for PlantUML (graphviz, ditaa, ascii-to-diagrams),
- Erlang development with Distel,
- ergonomics (ace modes, ace jumps, autocomplete, etc)...
